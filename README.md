// Features
// 1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.

// 2. Post Viewing: The access to the blog page should allow the user to view all their posts.

// 3. Post Update/Delete: Users should edit and delete posts as needed.

// 3. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
// Technical Requirements

// 1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.

// 2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.


// Timeline
// Hour 0: Planning

// Gather content and design ideas, and create wireframes and mockups. Plan out how the application will work, which routes might be necessary, and which pages need to be made.

// Hour 1:  Setup

// Set up the project repository, initialize the Node.js application, and install necessary dependencies (Express.js, EJS).

// Create the application structure, including routes, views, and static files.

// Set up the Express.js server and define the necessary routes.

// Hour 2-3: Implementing Features

// Implement the post creation feature. This includes creating the form on the home page and handling the form submission on the server.

// Implement the post-viewing feature. This includes displaying all the posts on the home page.

// Implement the post edit feature. This includes using a form to load the existing blog post and allowing the user to edit and save the post.

// Implement the delete feature. This allows the user to click a button and remove the post from the home page.

// Implement the alternative list to show different to-do tasks.


// Test the application to ensure that post creation and viewing are working correctly.
// Hour 4-5: Styling and Polishing

// Style the application. This includes creating a CSS file, linking it to your EJS templates, and writing CSS or using Bootstrap/Flexbox/Grid to style the application.

// Test the application on different devices and browsers to ensure the styling works correctly.

// Fix any bugs or issues that came up during testing.
